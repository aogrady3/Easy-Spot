#  Easy Spot

React Native Mobile Application, which allows users to rent their personal driveways! Still under development so stay tuned for further updates!

## :exclamation: Motivation

Growing up in the Bronx I have always had trouble parking or finding available spots. Whether it looking for parking by the 6 train or visiting family I always noticed a lack of street parking but tons of empty driveways. After being confronted with this problem on countless occasions I created the mobile application Easy Spot, a mobile application that allows users to rent their personal driveways!

## :car: Functionality

* Users can sign in using any active email address, and be authenticated via Firebase
* A map will grab a users current location, and show all available spots in the nearby area
* Users can add their driveway to the map, so others can view and rent it
* A user can view a custom page of Driveway information before deciding to rent a driveway
* After confirming their purchase a user will be navigated to their destination via Google Maps API

## :hammer_and_pick: Built With

Easy Spot’s  front-end consist primarily of React-Native, and CSS. Modular React Native components allowed for easy design implementation throughout. Personal CSS contributed to most of the UI/UX of the site.

Easy Spot’s back-end consist primarily of firebase path querying, and a collection of marker documents consisting of a driveways latitude and longitude coordinates.

* Javascript
* React-Native
* React-Native-Maps
* React-Navigation
